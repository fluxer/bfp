Poole has basic support for content generation using Python code inlined in
page files. This is everything but a clear separation of logic and content but
for simple sites this is just a pragmatic way to get things done fast.
For instance the menu on this page is generated by some inlined Python code in
the project's `page.html` file.

Just ignore this feature if you don't need it :)

Content generation by inlined Python code is good to add some zest to your
site. If you use it a lot, you better go with more sophisticated site
generators like [Hyde](http://ringce.com/hyde).
