Camelot! What do you mean? And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Ah, now

You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a

empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your
mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I

new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Now, look here, my good man.
