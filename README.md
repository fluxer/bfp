[ ![Codeship Status for fluxer/bfp](https://codeship.com/projects/123e70d0-af99-0132-594f-5edd39caaea8/status?branch=master)](https://codeship.com/projects/69262)

## Requirements

The following software is required:

### Runtime

[Coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/) (or [Busybox](http://www.busybox.net/)),
[kmod](https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/kmod/) (or [Busybox](http://www.busybox.net/)),
[Findutils](http://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/) (or [Busybox](http://www.busybox.net/)),
[Busybox](http://www.busybox.net/),
[GNU Tar](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/) (or [Busybox](http://www.busybox.net/)/[libarchive](http://www.libarchive.org/)),
[PaX Utilities](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Hardened/PaX_Utilities),
[file](http://darwinsys.com/file/),
[GNU Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/),
[Git](http://git-scm.com/),
[GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/),
[Python](https://www.python.org/),
[GNU C Library](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/) (or [uClibc](http://www.uclibc.org/)/[musl libc](http://www.musl-libc.org/)),
[systemd](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) (or [eudev](https://github.com/gentoo/eudev))

### Build time

[Perl](https://www.perl.org/),
[Cython](http://cython.org/),
[gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/)

How and where from you will obtain those is up to you, altought compatibility
with Busybox, GNU and POSIX tools is prime goal but not guaranteed so for an
example some old versions or even build configuration of those may not support
all required features.

## Building and installing

The build system requires Cython if changes to the .py files are made. It
translates the Python files into C code from which shared modules and binaries
are build. To build and install all sub-projects all you have to do is issue
the following command:

```
make
sudo make install
```

Alternatively to build and install against Python 3:

```
make PYTHON=python3
sudo make PYTHON=python3 install
```

If you did change the .py files do the following prior to building and
installing:

```
make sources
```
