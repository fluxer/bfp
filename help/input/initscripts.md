## NAME

initscripts - System initialization scripts

## DESCRIPTION

Set of **Bash** scripts to bring the system up in usable state with the help of Busybox's **init**

## OVERVIEW

Every **Operating System** requires some sort of process control initialization program
which brings the system up to state in which the user can operate, **init** is one
of them and is Linux specifiec. But it can not handle the process on itself alone thus
the **initscripts** assist it to do its job.

**init** executes different programs in different stages (runlevels) which breaks down
the whole process so it fits different use cases (such as administration and repairs),
there are four (4) scripts in that matter:

### rc.sysinit

system initialization

### rc.wait

wait script

### rc.shutdown

system shutdown (halt or reboot)

*rc.sysinit* is first script that is executed. It makes sure that all preperations are done
on the system environment. Pseudo filesystems, devices nodes, environmental variables and
others are initialized to sane defaults.

*rc.wait* continues where *rc.sysinit* left off and can be used to make additional system
state changes.

*rc.shutdown* is responsible to halt or reboot the system without breakage such as filesystem
inconsistency. It is almost the same as *rc.sysinit* but in reverse order.

But there is a reason why those are **Bash** scripts and not **C**/**C++** binaries or something
else, that is portability, share-code feature, and most of all easily hackable by anyone who
wants to get involved with it and contribute. This is done by providing a common file
*/etc/rc.d/functions* which holds functions and sane environmental variables. Among the other
things it is also used by the deamons which should run on the system to avoid dublicating code
functionality.

## CONFIGURATION

Configring the **initscripts** behavior is done via a single file - */etc/rc.conf*. More about
that in its help page [rc.conf](rc.conf.html). If you want to go deeper into this you will have
to take a look at **boot**(7), **init**(8) and/or [inittab](inittab.html).

## FUNCTIONS

The */etc/rc.d/functions* file is used by all initialization scripts (see overview) to be source
of all code that is shared among them, provides extra functions for the daemons and other
third-party scripts and tools. The functions which are defind in */etc/rc.d/functions* are grouped
in the format *group_program_action*, all of those do not contain special characters to avoid
confusion and to be easy to pick up.

### group

group of functions with simmilar functionality, three (3) characters string

### program

program to be executed, one (1) word string

### action

action to be taken by the program, one (1) word string

## HOOKS

Functions can be used to include custom code in various places in the **initscripts**. Those
functions reside in */etc/rc.d/functions.d*. The format is **Bash** and should follow the example:

    function_name() { ... }

    add_hook hook function_name

where *hook* is the stage in which this function should be inserted and executed. 
The first word before the underscore represents the rc script in which the function is inserted,
the second word represends the action that will follow after the function. This is useful in
case you want to override, add or remove certain feature of the **initscripts**.

It is allowed to register several hook functions for the same *hook* as in regular **Bash** script.
Is is also allowed to register the same hook function for several *hooks*.

The following hooks are supported

### sysinit_start

at the beginning of *rc.sysinit*, before the Kernel paramters are configured

### sysinit_udevstart

before UDev daemon is launched

### sysinit_modules

before the user-specified modules are loaded

### sysinit_udevsettle

before uevents are settled

### sysinit_hwclock

before system time is adjusted

### sysinit_swap

before Swap partitions are activated

### sysinit_remount

before Root filesystem is remounted read-write

### sysinit_leftovers

before leftover-files are removed

### sysinit_seed

before random-seed is restored

### sysinit_dmesg

before dmesg log is saved

### sysinit_fsck

before all local checks are performed

### sysinit_mount

before all local filesystems are mounted

### sysinit_timezone

before Time Zone is setuped

### sysinit_consoles

before virtual Consoles are setuped

### sysinit_consolefont

before Console fonts are setuped

### sysinit_consolemap

before Console map is setuped

### sysinit_keyboardmap

before Keyboard map is setuped

### sysinit_hostname

before hostname is setuped

### sysinit_loopback

before loopback interface is broght up

### sysinit_daemons

before automatic daemons are started

### sysinit_end

at the end of *rc.sysinit*

### shutdown_start

at the beginning of *rc.shutdown*, before daemons are stopped

### shutdown_udevstop

before UDev daemon is stopped

### shutdown_seed

before random-seed is saved

### shutdown_timezone

before Time Zone is setuped

### shutdown_killall

before all processes are killed

### shutdown_swap

before swap-backend filesystems are unmounted

### shutdown_umount

before all filesystems are unmounted

### shutdown_poweroff

at the end of *rc.shutdown*

## DAEMONS

Daemons are **Bash** scripts which run processes in the background to do their thing, waiting for
input, specifiec even to accure or something else. Those daemons can be started, stopped and/or
restarted when needed using the [rc.d](rc.d.html) tool which is also provided by **initscripts** and are 
located in separate directory */etc/rc.d*. More information about it in [rc.d](rc.d.html) help page.

## EXAMPLES

The following is example daemon script, use it as a reference when writing daemon scripts:

    #!/bin/bash
    #
    # /etc/rc.d/privoxy: start/restart/stop privoxy daemon
    #

    . /etc/rc.conf
    . /etc/rc.d/functions

    _bin=$(type -pf privoxy)
    _args="/etc/privoxy/config"
    _pid=$(pidof -o %PPID privoxy)

    case "$1" in
        start)
            if [ -z "$_pid" ]; then
                exec_cmd "Starting Privacy Enhancing Proxy" "$_bin" $_args
                [ "$?" = "0" ] && echo "$(pidof -o %PPID privoxy)" > /run/privoxy.pid
            fi
            ;;

        stop)
            if [ -n "$_pid" ];then
                exec_cmd "Stopping Privacy Enhancing Proxy" kill "$_pid"
                [ "$?" = "0" ] && rm -f /run/privoxy.pid
            fi
            ;;

        restart)
            $0 stop
            sleep 3
            $0 start
            ;;

        *)
            echo "usage: $0 {start|stop|restart}"
            exit 1
            ;;
    esac

    # End of file
