spm-tools - Source Package Manager Tools

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	spm-tools [-h] [--debug] [--version]
                 {dist,edit,lint,merge,sane,clean,check,which,pack} ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Source Package Manager Tools (SPMT) packs additional utilities to assist in the
system maintenance.

With the tools you can distribute tarballs of port(s) and share them with friends
so that other can benefit from your work. Along with the tarballs sources, such
as patches and archives, can be optionally fetched and packed in the tarball.

Runtime dependencies of binaries, libraries and scripts can be checked to ensure
the system consistency which is useful, for an example, when cross-compiling or
when targets where force removed from the system.

Checking for various system issues such as cross-filesystem udev rules and
symbolic links can be perfomed. Also ports sanity can be checked for missing
maintainer, /dev/null output recirections (which is bad and hides problems when
they occure) and more.

Dealing with files backed up by SPM can be done in merge mode, interactively.

Editing SRCBUILD files can easily be done without knowing the exact path in the
repositories directory, the editor is picked for the EDITOR environmental
variable with fallback to Vim.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Create a tarball of all sources, SRCBUILD, patches, etc. of grub and put the
tarball in the current directory:

    sudo spm-tools dist -sc -d=. grub

Run check of runtime dependencies of python, excluding various non-important
files such as headers, and correct them if necessary:

    sudo spm-tools check -faD python

Check for unneeded local targets, in other words - targets that are not required
by other local target:

    spm-tools clean

Run check for possible "bad things" on all local targets to ensure that the
system is in good condition, e.g. no cross-filesystem symlinks which can be
troublesome with a separate /usr partition:

    spm-tools lint -a $(spm local -pn ^)

Run check for possible "bad things" on all remote targets to ensure that the
ports are in good condition, e.g. there are at least 2-variables defined
(version and description):

    spm-tools sane -a $(spm remote -pn ^)

Merge all files backed up by SPM with the original ones:

    sudo spm-tools merge

Edit the glibc SRCBUILD, e.g. to apply some custom configure parameters:

    sudo spm-tools edit glibc

Print full path to vim target:

    spm-tools which -p vim

Backup gcc filese into tarball:

    spm-tools pack gcc

=head1 EXIT STATUS

SPM returns 0 on success and other on failure.
	
=head2 Unexpected error (1)

This is a general error. Triggered, most likely, by something that SPM is
not able to handle.

=head2 Internal error (2)

This error raises when a dependency, library, or other important thing
is missing or failed.

=head2 CONFIGPARSER (3)

This error raises when, at runtime, the module responsible for parsing the
configuration files fails badly. Its job usually is to parse the main,
repositories and mirrors configuration files.

=head2 SUBPROCESS (4)

This error raises when a subprocess, such as Git or Bash, failed to
execute a sub-command.

=head2 URLLIB (5)

This error raises when, at the prepare stage, the module responsible for
fetching files hits a wall. This can be '404 Not Found' or
'500 Internal Server Error'. For more info visit
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes.

=head2 TARFILE (6)

This error raises when, at the prepare or merge stage, the module
responsible for compressing and decompressing Tar archives fails badly.

=head2 ZIPFILE (7)

This error raises when, at the prepare stage, the module responsible
for compressing and decompressing Zip archives fails badly.

=head2 SHUTIL (8)

This error raises when the module responsible for shell or system
operations fails badly. Its job usually is to copy or remove files and
directories.

=head2 OS (9)

This error raises when the module responsible for system files and
directories information gathering fails badly. Its job usually is to
check if X is file, symbolic link or directory.

=head2 IO (10)

This error raises when there is something wrong with the file/directory
permissions.

=head2 REGEXP (11)

This error raises when the module responsible for regular expressions
matching fails badly. If in doubt you should check the Python Re module
reference at http://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html.

=head2 Interupt signal received (12)

This error raises when the user triggers keyboard interrupt via Ctrl+C key
combination.

=head1 BUGS

=head2 PYTHON MODULES

HTTPS requests do not do any verification of the server's certificate.
For more info visit http://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib2.html. Note that
this concerns only the internal fetcher, thus using external fetcher (curl or
wget) is highly recommended.

There are three tar formats that are supported by the tarfile module. For more
info visit http://docs.python.org/2/library/tarfile.html#supported-tar-formats.
Note that the Zip and XZ formats are supported by SPM, the later via subprocess
calling `tar` or `bsdtar` directly.

=head2 SPM

Single quote inside double quoted text (and vice-versa) in the SRCBUILD variables
break the parser.
