=head1 NAME

cold - Cold

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    cold [-h] [-t TMP] [-i INTERPRETER] [-o OUTPUT] [--keep] [--debug]
        [--version] PATH [PATH ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Cold is a simple Python files bundle creator. All arguments passed to it as
PATH, which could be either directory or plain file, is compressed. A main
file is created that will import the first argumetns from the PATH list and
that's basiscly it.

It does not create a copy of the Python interpreter itself it creates a bundle
of Python scripts. It also sucks and works by pure luck.
