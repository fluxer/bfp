=head1 NAME

powerd - Power Daemon

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Power Daemon manages system power state and filesystems. This including rebooting,
shutting down, suspending the system, controlling cpu and other devices power
saving features. Is uses dbus for Inter Processes Communcation (IPC) to secure
the actions taken via dbus policies.

The Power Daemon configuration is done via one single configuration file -
/etc/powerd.conf. For more information see powerd.conf(5).

A command-line utillity for controlling `powerd` is provided - powerctl. It can
tell the running `powerd` process to execute actions on user demands instead of
doing it on own consideration. For more information see powerctl(8)
