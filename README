## WARNING ##

This software is not complete and as such it does not represent the final
product. During the state of its development and stabilization major changes
may be done without explicit warning. It has known and unknown issues and
should be used with caution. You have been warned!

## INFORMATION ##

This collection of software includes libraries, tools, desktop applications,
coresponding documentation and configuration files.

They are written to suite my own needs but do not hesitate to join me and
improve the software if you like it, find it useful or something else. Note that
I do not follow code style much, but sanitising it can be done on demand, tough
it is done from time to time.

The purpose of the projects is to have a package of software that tries to
complete the GNU command line interface (CLI) and arsenal of tools offered with
minimum dependencies, written in easy to code programming language, integrated
into each other with only one thing in mind - KISS! If this does not suit you -
fine. Priorities of the projects - 1) speed, 2) stability, 3) security. If you
don't like it - fine!
