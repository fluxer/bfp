Various projects that will not suite everyone. This includes libraries, tools,
desktop applications, coresponding documentation and configuration files.

They are written to suite my own needs but do not hesitate to join me and
improve the software if you like it, find it useful or something else. Note
that I do not follow code style much, but sanitising the code can be done on
demand if that is required, tough I do it from time to time.

The purpose of the projects is to have a package of software that tries to
complete the GNU command line interface (CLI) and arsenal of tools offered
with minimum dependencies, written in easy to code programming language,
integrated into each other with only one thing in mind - KISS! If this does
not suit you - fine. Priorities of the projects - 1) speed, 2) stability,
3) security. If you don't like it - fine!
