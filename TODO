## SPM ##
 * Fix all bugs noted with FIXME
 * Use Makefiles for build scripts?
 * Optionally remove build depends that are not required by local target after build
 * Optimize backing up of files

## ALL (on regular basis) ##
 * Run PyLint and do some kung-foo on the code style
 * Make use of sys.prefix and use less hardcode paths
 * Sanitize the code
 * Value checks to ensure proper behavior
 * Document methods the right way (https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt)
