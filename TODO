## SPM ##
 * Complete all tasks noted with FIXME/TODO
 * Optionally remove build depends that are not required by local target after build
 * Check for absolute path symlinks in SRCBUILDs
 * Implement services trigger (rc.d restart foo)
 * Implement trigger invocation only on file content change
 * Build target(s) from source when binary not available?
 * Make the python byte-compile work for versions other than what SPM has been run from
 * Implement a database lock limmiting the clients to two (2) to prevent issues due to caching

## ALL (on regular basis) ##
 * Run PyLint and do some kung-foo on the code style
 * Make use of sys.prefix and use less hardcode paths
 * Sanitize the code
